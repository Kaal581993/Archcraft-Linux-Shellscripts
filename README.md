# Archcraft-Linux-Shellscripts

Best thing about being a Linux user is your privacy. By this it means you keep your personal data Private.

Long story short: My licensed windows machine was hacked in college running latest version of Windows with all security patch applied and I came to know my screen leaks over college network where one my faculty would frame internal question papers based on topics I didn't study, but Since I had a Comp-Engg Diploma, I knew it was hacked and since then, Linux has been my best friend ever.

I keep trying new Linux distributions and have learned a lot of automation process that is hardly possible in Windows.

So here's are some example of Arch-Craft quick-installation and setup shellscripts that you write to automate the setup process.

**#StaySecure, #StayDigitallySafe and #Happyhacking.**

**#Guide to use the scripts:**

**sudo chmod +x file_name.sh** -- user to give user read write and execute access to the user.

**sudo ./file_name.sh** -- execute the the shellscript file
